        <h1> Ems, Rems or Pixels - Which One Should I Use? </h1>

        <section class="rem">
            <h2> Rem </h2>
            <p> Rem stands for the root element font size. The default root element font size is 16px (unless we change
                it ). Rem is a relative unit that allows us to preserve accessbility (i.e. the user can change the font
                size) and is easier to use than em.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="em">
            <h2> Em </h2>
            <p> Em is the parent element's font size. It is a relative unit, but a little tricky to work with as it is
                relative to the parent element. You will see it used sometimes for font size, but it is better used for
                margin and padding as we can make things scale proportionately. </p>
            
        </section>

        <section class="em2">
            <h2> Em </h2>
            <p> Em is the parent element's font size. It is a relative unit, but a little tricky to work with as it is
                relative to the parent element. You will see it used sometimes for font size, but it is better used for
                margin and padding as we can make things scale proportionately. </p>
        </section>

        <section class="pixel">
            <h2> What about pixels? </h2>
            <p> Pixels are absolute units. They are handy when it comes to smaller adjusments.</p>
